Capstone: Gear Head

Project Purpose:
This store is dedicated to selling shoes, but we can expand our product line to include other clothing products like shirts and hoodies based on demand. Our managers will have complete control over the storeâ€™s inventory through the ability to create, read, update, and delete products. Customers can browse and purchase products from our store, but they will not have the ability to modify or remove any of the products.
