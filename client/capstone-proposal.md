Name of Student: Bodie Wood
Name of Project: Gear Up
Project's Purpose or Goal: This store is dedicated to selling shoes, but we can expand our product line to include other clothing products like shirts and hoodies based on demand. Our managers will have complete control over the store’s inventory through the ability to create, read, update, and delete products. Customers can browse and purchase products from our store, but they will not have the ability to modify or remove any of the products. 
List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
•	Full CRUD functionality for managers
•	Site visitors can:
o	 View products
o	 Add products to cart.
o	Remove products from cart.
•	Sign-in page for customers
•	Only customers who have logged in are able to purchase products.
•	Customers can view and edit their carts.
•	Carts are updated depending on products and their prices.
•	Products can be filtered depending on the following:
o	New & Featured
o	Men
o	Women
o	Kids
o	Accessories
o	Sales
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

•	JavaScript
•	React
•	Redux
•	Express
•	Node

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
•	Allow site visitors to locate physical stores using the Mapbox API
•	Enable customers to apply discount codes to their shopping carts, which will allow them to purchase products at a discounted price. This feature can be used to incentivize customers to complete their purchased or to promote special offers and deals.
•	Enhance the user experience by implementing a “Favorites” feature that allows visitors to save their preferred products for future reference. This section should provide a convenient and accessible way for users to store and organize their favorite items, without necessarily committing to purchase them. The Favorites section can also be used to recommend related products.
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
•	Canvas-Confetti
•	React-hot-Toast
•	Mapbox API
